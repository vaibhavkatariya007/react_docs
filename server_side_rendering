// SERVER SIDE RENDERING


Whatâ€™s the difference between client-side rendering and server-side rendering?
In Client-side rendering, your browser downloads a minimal HTML page. It renders the JavaScript and 
fills the content into it.

Server-side rendering, on the other hand, renders the React components on the server. The output is HTML content.
