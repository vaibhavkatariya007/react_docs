// SERVER SIDE RENDERING


Whatâ€™s the difference between client-side rendering and server-side rendering?
In Client-side rendering, your browser downloads a minimal HTML page. It renders the JavaScript and 
fills the content into it.

Server-side rendering, on the other hand, renders the React components on the server. The output is HTML content.

Cons of Rendering React on the Server
SSR can improve performance if your application is small. But it can also degrade performance if it is heavy.
It increases response time (and it can be worse if the server is busy).
It increases response size, which means the page takes longer to load.
It increases the complexity of the application.
